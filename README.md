## Hello! I am Amaan Lakhani.

I love to deep dive on topics I don’t know much about for the sake of learning.

I love long-distance road and trail running, but have taken more to lifting recently. I have run several marathons and am always up for a run.

Let’s connect! I love to chat about development, product, and connect people however I can.
